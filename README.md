# Auto-reconnection-for-Bluetooth-device
This script was build for personal use and as studying project, but I left it here in case that it may be useful for someone.


Attention:  this script supports Linux only!


To use this script you need to download one and than set a MAC address of your Bluetooth device manually at the top of the code.
If you want to modify timing it's recommended to edit delays and amount of attempts to pair.

Comments will help you navigate through the code.
